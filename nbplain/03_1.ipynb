    "Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist, has just returned from a six-month survey of the North Pacific Gyre, where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. She has 1520 samples in all and now needs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run each sample through an assay machine that will measure the relative abundance of 300 different proteins. The machine's output for a single sample is a file with one line for each protein.\n",
    "2. Calculate statistics for each of the proteins separately using a program her supervisor wrote called `goostats`.\n",
    "3. Write up results. Her supervisor would really like her to do this by the end of the month so that her paper can appear in an upcoming special issue of Aquatic Goo Letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes about half an hour for the assay machine to process each sample. The good news is that it only takes two minutes to set each one up. Since her lab has eight assay machines that she can use in parallel, this step will \"only\" take about two weeks."

    "The bad news is that if she has to run `goostats` by hand, she'll have to enter filenames and click \"OK\" 1520 times. At 30 seconds per sample, the whole process will take more than 12 hours (and that's assuming the best-case scenario where she is ready to enter the next file name as soon as the previous sample analysis has finished). This zero-breaks always-ready scenario is only achieveable by a machine so it would likely take much longer than 12 hours, not to mention that the chances of her typing all of those commands correctly are practically zero. Missing that paper deadline is looking increasingly likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few lessons will explore what she should do instead. More specifically, they explain how she can use a command shell to automate the repetitive steps in her processing pipeline so that her computer can work 24 hours a day while she writes her paper. As a bonus, once she has put a processing pipeline together, she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data."
