    "\n",
    "On a high-performance computing system, it is often the case that no software is loaded by default. If we want to use a software package, we will need to “load” it ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start using individual software packages, however, we should understand the reasoning behind this approach. The three biggest factors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- software incompatibilities;\n",
    "- versioning;\n",
    "- dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software incompatibility is a major headache for programmers. Sometimes the presence (or absence) of a software package will break others that depend on it. Two of the most famous examples are Python 2 and 3 and C compiler versions. Python 3 famously provides a python command that conflicts with that provided by Python 2. Software compiled against a newer version of the C libraries and then used when they are not present will result in a nasty 'GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found error, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software versioning is another common issue. A team might depend on a certain package version for their research project - if the software version was to change (for instance, if a package was updated), it might affect their results. Having access to multiple software versions allow a set of researchers to prevent software versioning issues from affecting their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies are where a particular software package (or even a particular version) depends on having access to another software package (or even a particular version of another software package). For example, the VASP materials science software may depend on having a particular version of the FFTW (Fastest Fourer Transform in the West) software library available for it to work."
